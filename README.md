# -Nodejs_Assignment

Quses 1   In this coding challenge, your task is to create a package&json file for your project using the npm init command& The package&json file is essential for managing dependencies, scripts, and other project"related
         details& Below is the expected folder structure


Ans  Creating a package.json file is a crucial step when setting up a Node.js project. You can use the npm init command to generate a package.json file. Below are the steps you can follow to create a basic package.json file:

1 Open your terminal.

2 Navigate to your project's root directory if you haven't already. You can use the cd command to change your working directory.

3 Run the npm init command and follow the prompts. You'll be asked various questions about your project. You can press Enter to accept the default values or provide your own:

npm init

Here's a basic example of what the prompts might look like:

*name: (your-project-name)

*version: (1.0.0)

*description: Your project description

*entry point: (index.js)

*test command:

*git repository: (your-git-repository)

*keywords:

*author: (your-name)

*license: (ISC)

4 After answering the prompts, npm will generate a package.json file based on your responses.

5 Review the generated package.json file to make sure it includes all the project-related details.


Here's a simple example of what the contents of a package.json file might look like:

{
  "name": "your-project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Your project description",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    // Your project's dependencies go here
  }
}

You can edit this file later to add project dependencies, scripts, and other details as your project evolves.

Remember to replace the example values with your project's actual information.


Ques 2
In the same project directory created in the above assignment, your task is to create a new file index.js and using the fs module add information about Node.js architecture to a new file nodejs_architecture.txt. Below are the expected files in the project folder

Ans   To create an index.js file and add information about Node.js architecture to a new nodejs_architecture.txt file using the Node.js fs module, you can follow these steps:

1 Create the index.js file:

Use a code editor or the command line to create a new file named index.js in your project directory.

2 Write JavaScript code to add information to the nodejs_architecture.txt file:

In your index.js file, you can use the fs module to read, write, or append data to a text file. Here's an example of how you can create a nodejs_architecture.txt file and add information to it:

const fs = require('fs');

const architectureInfo = `
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and network applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

Some key features of Node.js architecture include:

- Single-threaded: Node.js is single-threaded and uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.
- Non-blocking: I/O operations, such as reading from a file or making network requests, do not block the main thread, allowing for high concurrency.
- Event-driven: Node.js is built around events and callbacks, making it ideal for handling real-time applications.
- CommonJS Modules: Node.js uses the CommonJS module system to organize and manage code.
`;

fs.writeFile('nodejs_architecture.txt', architectureInfo, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error writing to the file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('Information written to nodejs_architecture.txt');
  }
});

In this code, we use fs.writeFile to create the nodejs_architecture.txt file and write the information about Node.js architecture to it. The content is provided as a template string in the architectureInfo variable.

3 Run your index.js file:

Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run your index.js file using the node command:

node index.js

4 Check the nodejs_architecture.txt file:

After running the index.js script, you should see a new file named nodejs_architecture.txt in your project directory. Open this file to verify that the architecture information has been added.

This code will create the nodejs_architecture.txt file and populate it with the provided information about Node.js architecture. You can customize the content and structure of the architecture information as needed.

Ques 3  Continuing assignment 2. Here, let’s create a new file named index.js and use the fs module to read the content of nodejs_architecture&txt and print the content to the console.


Ans  To read the content of the nodejs_architecture.txt file and print it to the console using the Node.js fs module, you can follow these steps:

1 Create the index.js file:

If you haven't already, create a new file named index.js in your project directory.

2 Write JavaScript code to read and print the content:

In your index.js file, you can use the fs module to read the content of the nodejs_architecture.txt file and then print it to the console. Here's how you can do it:

const fs = require('fs');

// Read the content of the 'nodejs_architecture.txt' file
fs.readFile('nodejs_architecture.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading the file:', err);
  } else {
    // Print the content to the console
    console.log('Content of nodejs_architecture.txt:');
    console.log(data);
  }
});

In this code, we use fs.readFile to read the content of the nodejs_architecture.txt file. The data is read as a string in UTF-8 encoding. The content of the file is then printed to the console.

3 Run your index.js file:

Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run your index.js file using the node command:

node index.js

4 Check the console output:

After running the index.js script, you should see the content of the nodejs_architecture.txt file printed to the console.

This code will read the content of the nodejs_architecture.txt file and display it in the console. Make sure the nodejs_architecture.txt file exists in your project directory with the architecture information you added earlier.

Ques  4   In this coding challenge, you will continue working with the file created in the previous assignments. Here your task is to access the existing nodejs_architecture&txt file and use the fs module to append additional data to it. Specifically, add some advantages of Node&js to the file and print the file content to the console.

Ans    To access the existing nodejs_architecture.txt file and append additional data (advantages of Node.js) to it using the Node.js fs module, and then print the updated file content to the console, you can follow these steps:

1 Open your index.js file if you have already created it, or create a new index.js file in your project directory.

2 Write JavaScript code to append data:

In your index.js file, you can use the fs module to append data to the existing nodejs_architecture.txt file. Here's how you can do it:

const fs = require('fs');

// Content to be appended (Node.js advantages)
const nodejsAdvantages = `
Additional Advantages of Node.js:

1. Non-blocking I/O: Node.js is known for its non-blocking, asynchronous I/O operations, which make it suitable for handling multiple concurrent requests efficiently.

2. Scalability: Node.js is designed with scalability in mind. It can handle a large number of simultaneous connections, making it ideal for real-time applications.

3. V8 JavaScript Engine: Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript engine from Google, known for its high-performance execution of JavaScript code.

4. Active Community: Node.js has a vibrant and active community that provides a wealth of open-source modules and libraries for various purposes.

`;

// Append data to the 'nodejs_architecture.txt' file
fs.appendFile('nodejs_architecture.txt', nodejsAdvantages, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error appending to the file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('Additional data appended to nodejs_architecture.txt');
  }
});

In this code, we define the content to be appended (advantages of Node.js) in the nodejsAdvantages variable and then use fs.appendFile to add this content to the existing nodejs_architecture.txt file.

3 Run your index.js file:

Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run your index.js file using the node command:

node index.js

4 Check the updated file content:

After running the index.js script, the additional advantages of Node.js will be appended to the nodejs_architecture.txt file. You can open the file to verify that the content has been added.

5 Print the updated file content to the console:

To print the updated content to the console, you can use the code provided in the previous response to read and display the file content using fs.readFile.

By following these steps, you can append the advantages of Node.js to the nodejs_architecture.txt file and then display the updated content in the console.

Ques 5  To wind up the fs module walk"through challenges, let’s delete the nodejs_architecture.txt file. On deletion print "File Deleted SuccessFully" to the console.

Ans   To delete the nodejs_architecture.txt file using the Node.js fs module and print a success message to the console upon successful deletion, you can follow these steps:

1 Create a new or use your existing index.js file.

2 Write JavaScript code to delete the file:

In your index.js file, you can use the fs module to delete the nodejs_architecture.txt file and print a success message. Here's how you can do it:

const fs = require('fs');

// Specify the file to be deleted
const fileToDelete = 'nodejs_architecture.txt';

// Delete the file
fs.unlink(fileToDelete, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error deleting the file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('File Deleted Successfully');
  }
});

In this code, we use fs.unlink to delete the specified file (nodejs_architecture.txt). If the deletion is successful, it will print the message "File Deleted Successfully" to the console. If there is an error, it will print an error message.

3 Run your index.js file:

Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run your index.js file using the node command:

node index.js

4 Check the console output:

After running the index.js script, you should see the success message "File Deleted Successfully" if the file deletion was successful. If there was an error during deletion, it will be logged to the console.

By following these steps, you can delete the nodejs_architecture.txt file and print a success message to the console upon successful deletion.


Ques 6  Assume a situation where our server restricts access to its configuration via the user interface. The only way to obtain the OS and release information is through a programmatic approach. In this challenge, you are expected to use the os module and print the os name and the os"release version to the console.


Ans  To obtain the OS name and release version programmatically in a Node.js application, you can use the built-in os module. Here's a code snippet to accomplish this:

const os = require('os');

// Get the OS name
const osName = os.type();

// Get the OS release version
const osRelease = os.release();

// Print the OS information to the console
console.log('OS Name:', osName);
console.log('OS Release Version:', osRelease);


In this code:

1 We first require the os module to access its functionality.

2 We use os.type() to get the OS name (e.g., "Windows_NT" for Windows, "Linux" for Linux, etc.).

3 We use os.release() to get the OS release version (e.g., "10.0.19042" for Windows 10, "5.4.0-86-generic" for a Linux kernel version, etc.).

4 Finally, we print the OS name and release version to the console.

When you run this code, it will display the OS name and release version for the system on which your Node.js application is running.


Ques  7   In this challenge, you are required to use Node.js and the built-in HTTP module to create a server that displays the text "I Am Happy To Learn Full Stack Web Development From PW Skills!" on the browser screen.The goal is to utilize the HTTP module to create an HTTP server, set the port, appropriate content type, and send the message as a response to the client's request, allowing it to display on the browser.


Ans  
To create a simple HTTP server in Node.js that displays the text "I Am Happy To Learn Full Stack Web Development From PW Skills!" in a web browser, you can follow these steps:

1 Create a new Node.js file (e.g., server.js) or use your existing project.

2 Write the code for the HTTP server:

Here's a basic example of how you can create an HTTP server using the built-in http module:

const http = require('http');

// Define the content to be displayed
const responseText = "I Am Happy To Learn Full Stack Web Development From PW Skills!";

// Create an HTTP server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Set the response headers
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.statusCode = 200;

  // Send the response text
  res.end(responseText);
});

// Set the port for the server to listen on
const port = 3000;

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});

In this code:

We require the http module to create an HTTP server.

We define the content to be displayed in the responseText variable.

We create an HTTP server using http.createServer(). In the server callback function, we set the response headers, status code, and send the responseText as the response.

We specify the port (e.g., 3000) on which the server should listen.

We start the server and log a message indicating that it's running.

3 Run your server:

Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where your server.js file is located, and run the server using the node command:

node server.js

4 Access the server in your web browser:

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port you specified). You should see the text "I Am Happy To Learn Full Stack Web Development From PW Skills!" displayed on the browser screen.

This code creates a basic Node.js HTTP server that responds with the specified text when accessed through a web browser. You can customize the response text and port as needed.


Ques 8  Let's simulate a subscription feature similar to YouTube. Using the events module, we'll create a custom event named "subscribe". When this event is triggered, it should display a message in the console indicating that the user has subscribed.

Ans  To simulate a subscription feature using the events module in Node.js and create a custom event named "subscribe," you can follow these steps:

Create a new Node.js file (e.g., subscription.js) or use your existing project.

Write the code to simulate the subscription feature:

Here's an example of how you can create a custom "subscribe" event using the events module:

const EventEmitter = require('events');

// Create an instance of the EventEmitter
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Define a custom event named "subscribe"
eventEmitter.on('subscribe', () => {
  console.log('User has subscribed!');
});

// Simulate a user subscribing (trigger the "subscribe" event)
eventEmitter.emit('subscribe');

In this code:

We require the events module and create an instance of the EventEmitter class.

We define a custom event named "subscribe" using eventEmitter.on(). When this event is triggered, it logs a message to the console indicating that the user has subscribed.

We simulate a user subscribing by emitting (triggering) the "subscribe" event using eventEmitter.emit('subscribe').

3 Run your subscription simulation:

Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where your subscription.js file is located, and run the script using the node command:

node subscription.js

4 Check the console output:

After running the script, you should see the message "User has subscribed!" displayed in the console, indicating that the "subscribe" event was triggered.

This code simulates a subscription feature similar to YouTube by creating a custom event named "subscribe" and triggering it to indicate that a user has subscribed. You can further expand this by adding more functionality and event handling as needed.



Ques  9  While working with the events module, one interesting observation is that when an event is created and called, the associated event handler is triggered1 However, what happens if we remove an event and then
try to call it? In this coding challenge letes create an event handler and call it1 Later letes remove the event handler and observe what happens when we call it.


Ans  In the Node.js events module, you can remove an event handler using the removeListener or off method. When you attempt to call a removed event, it won't trigger the event handler because it's no longer associated with the event. Here's a demonstration of this behavior:

const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Define a custom event named "myEvent" and its handler
function myEventHandler() {
  console.log('Event handler is triggered.');
}

// Add the event handler to the "myEvent" event
eventEmitter.on('myEvent', myEventHandler);

// Emit (trigger) the "myEvent" event
eventEmitter.emit('myEvent'); // Event handler is triggered.

// Remove the event handler from the "myEvent" event
eventEmitter.removeListener('myEvent', myEventHandler);

// Attempt to emit the "myEvent" event after removing the handler
eventEmitter.emit('myEvent'); // No output; the event handler is removed.

In this code:

1 We create an instance of the EventEmitter and define a custom event named "myEvent" along with its event handler.

2 We add the event handler to the "myEvent" event using the on method and trigger the event using emit. This results in the event handler being called and displaying the message.

3 We remove the event handler from the "myEvent" event using the removeListener method.

4 When we attempt to emit the "myEvent" event after removing the handler, nothing is displayed in the console. This is because the event handler has been removed and is no longer associated with the event.

This demonstrates that once an event handler is removed, calling the event won't trigger the removed handler.

Ques 10   In continuation of the 8th question, let's now explore the concept of the maximum number of listeners allowed for event handlers. For this coding challenge, your task is to determine the current maximum
number of event listeners associated with an event and then set the maximum number of event listeners to 5. Note that the default maximum number of listeners might vary. Your task is to limit the number of listeners
to 5.

Ans    
In the Node.js events module, you can determine the current maximum number of event listeners associated with an event using the getMaxListeners method. By default, the maximum number of listeners is set to 10, but you can change it to any number using the setMaxListeners method. Here's how you can determine and set the maximum number of listeners to 5 for an event

const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Determine the current maximum number of listeners for an event
const currentMaxListeners = eventEmitter.getMaxListeners();

// Log the current maximum number of listeners
console.log('Current Maximum Listeners:', currentMaxListeners);

// Set the maximum number of listeners for an event to 5
eventEmitter.setMaxListeners(5);

// Log the updated maximum number of listeners
console.log('Updated Maximum Listeners:', eventEmitter.getMaxListeners());

In this code:

1 We create an instance of the EventEmitter.

2 We use the getMaxListeners method to determine the current maximum number of event listeners. By default, this value is 10, but it can be different depending on the context.

3 We log the current maximum number of listeners to the console.

4 We use the setMaxListeners method to set the maximum number of event listeners for the event to 5.

5 We log the updated maximum number of listeners to the console, which should now be 5.

This code allows you to determine the current maximum number of listeners for an event and set it to a specific value, in this case, 5. You can adjust the maximum number of listeners as needed for your application.
